# Backrooms: Liminal Adventure
This is a Fabric 1.18.1 mod adding the Backrooms to Minecraft.

\[I'm going to finish this README later.\]

## Features

This mod, by itself will add Levels 0-TBD of the Backrooms to Minecraft. These will likely primarily be based on the Wikidot (Tech Support) versions of these Levels, though this does not exclude the possibility of elements from elsewhere being included.

\[TODO\]


### Addon system

This mod will have a system for addon mods to integrate with this mod and add new Levels, and possibly even alter or replace existing Levels. Anyone will be free to develop an addon for this mod, as long as they comply with the LGPL-v3.0 license terms of this mod.


## Building and Running

\[TODO\]


## License

This mod is licensed under the LGPL v3.0.
